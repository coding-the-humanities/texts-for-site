    **Sabrina Sauer** is assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam. With a background in acting and a PhD on living labs, she viewed the students in the Coding the Humanities pilot as her lab rats. She refrained from performing crude experiments on them, and facilitated and guarded the collaborative space created in this alternative and intensive classroom setting.

    **Nigel Hamlin** has spent a long career working in business management, IT and electronics and is very pleased to be working with this team and having the opportunity to pass on some of his hard-earned experience and knowledge. One of his main areas of responsibility is to take care of the overall business planning and keep his eye on the infamous 'big picture' whilst everyone else is (hopefully) slaving away on the fine details!Â
