  On Friday evening, the crew and students of Coding the Humanities were joined for dinner by a select, but diverse group of guests who work on the edges of education, technology, and research. With a wonderful view over the water and a large pirate ship at the Scheepvaartmuseum in Amsterdam, we discussed the end of learning.

  How can you learn in a space where collaboration is more important than actual achievement? Where working the hardest doesn't necessarily lead to the best results? Where cheating is encouraged? These questions were posed by Jan Hein Hoogstad and Sabrina Sauer in an introductory presentation. A discussion on the definition of cheating in education as opposed to programming flamed up immediately. 

  "Patience you must have my young padawan," Yoda teaches Luke Skywalker in Star Wars as he explains the ways of the Yedi. Without dismissing Yoda's wisdom, tonight we attempted precisely to overturn this classical and widely proclaimed educational virtue and discuss the virtue of impatience instead. Likewise, diligence made place for laziness, and modesty for hubris. Introducing [Larry Wall's](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris) virtues of computer programming to education, we set up for a discussion of their implications on the practice of learning. 

  ## Impatience, Laziness, and Hubris

  Each table received a set of markers, a large, white sheet of paper and one of the three virtues: impatience, laziness, or hubris. The groups were asked to discuss how this virtue could be introduced into education, come up with a concrete example and make a poster to present their idea. After a table discussion of 45 minutes, the groups presented their findings to each other on the steps of the museum jetty.

  > "I really enjoyed the table discussions. There were a few ideas that went around that inspired me with new ideas for teaching methods that I want to pick up and experiment with."

  The first group discussed how laziness can redefine the act of reading a book. How can you read a book in an amount of time that's too short to finish it? Possible solutions the group came up with were splitting the parts among a group, have someone else explain to you what it's about or read a summary and hope for the best. After all, they argued, it's about knowing what's in the book rather than the act of reading itself. Suddenly what seems cheating isn't cheating anymore, but efficient learning. 

  Moving from laziness to impatience, the second group presented how impatient people want to get somewhere sooner rather than later, and learn through trial and error. Impatience makes people leap for a small goal quickly rather than holding out for a larger one. Yet, reaching a few small goals in succession leads to something big. 

  The final group discussed a learning environment where hubris is stimulated. Imagine a classroom where hierarchy is dynamic, where students can become teachers if they know more about a certain subject, where everyone can challenge authority and challenge the challenging of authority itself, and where it's OK to try stuff and fail. In this classroom, the teacher facilitates a process of learning rather than force feeding facts. The group thought of objects that could help stimulate people to speak up–even the introverts. Examples were a rubber duck, a soap box, and a microphone.

  ## Exchanging Ideas 

  As the sun set, we moved back inside where the discussions continued over dinner. The presentation and table discussions had created a common ground for all of the guests, despite different backgrounds–from IT consultancy to primary school teaching.

  > "I wonder how we can approach younger children to get into programming. Today, there's too much focus on just giving them an iPad. There's joy in creating and kids should learn that."

  People moved around the tables at their own pace. New projects were thought of, lesson plans created and phone numbers exchanged. The night ended in the middle of the square of the museum, where the sky was brightly illuminated by star-like lights. We wanted to connect people and we did. We're looking forward to future collaborations.
