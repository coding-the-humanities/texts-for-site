### Coding the Humanities’s adopted family
## WTHX
On Thursday the 25th and Friday 26th of October we were invited for the WTHX conference in The Hague (http://wthx.org). We were invited by the co-organising graphic and interactive-design company called Lust (http://lust.nl/). They invited professionals from the field of justice, peace, security, designers and ‘techies’ to collaboratively think about the existing problems in the fields of justice, peace and security. Our first impression of the Conference was WOW! The unique venue was situated right on the beach and could only be reached via a walk through the dunes. This walk and view over the ocean resulted for me in a ‘zen feeling’, what I believe was a good way to prepare the guests to come to the conference clear and open minded.  

## Collaborative Knowledge Production
The Hackathon was set-up in three tracks (Peace, Security and Justice), within these tracks there were a number of issues to ‘solve’. For example how could technology keep the peace in the spreading of Ebola? By letting the guests choose their own track and issue organically multidisciplinary groups arose. This mix of people with different backgrounds, skills and professions is exactly what Coding the Humanities stands for, also the method of collaborative knowledge production is at the heart of Coding the Humanities. We therefore felt immediately at home.    

## Experts Lightning Talk
The most inspiring and mind shifting talk to me was the presentation by Andreas Siagian from Lifepatch Indonesia (http://lifepatch.org/). Andreas Siagian is a cross disciplinary artist with an engineering background. Lifepatch is a citizen initiative that work on creative and effective applications in art, science and technology. They are a group of people living, eating and sleeping together in a villa, that also acts as their workspace. They stand for open source knowledge and give workshops and provide tutorials on numerous subjects (for example wine making and how to build your own radio broadcasting transmission). I believe that their views on open source are a perfect example of how to give back to the people (all of us) just by sharing knowledge and skills. The egg that he planted in me with his presentation was mainly that knowledge shouldn’t be pursued for personal enlightenment but is there to be passed on.  

## Love for WTH
We immediately fell in love with Lust an it’s LustLab because they also believe in an open and broad approach towards issues. Meaning there is not one solution, system or approach to a ‘problem’, but should be formed by the needs around the ‘problem’ and then should be worked out in technical solutions. All of these similarities and the common grounds that Lust and Coding the Humanities share are obviously a good base for family ties and we hope we will have a fruitful future ahead of us. 

Thank you Lust and till next time…
