## Time, the final frontier

The technology to travel time might be currently unavailable, but that will not stop humanity from pursuing its ultimate goal; to boldly go WHEN no one has gone before! To pierce the veil of reality and transcend the fourth dimension! To go back in time and completely disregard the consequences of their actions, subsequently causing a temporal paradox and sending the universe into an age of darkness!

But enough with the tomfoolery.

## Cold and Lonely

It was the fourth of November, and I just witnessed the 8:58 train to The Hague scoot away into the distance. The dreary, cold Tuesday morning slightly amplified the feeling of disappointment draping my soul, and the fact that I am not much of a morning person did also happily contribute to this feeling. After taking the next train, walking in and out of the same building I was not supposed to be and frantically texting and calling with my fellow interns, I finally met up with the students from the Sandberg Institute at the (correct) location of the LUSTlab. 

They are a lovely and very creative bunch of people, all of them design students from various countries; France, Germany, Poland, The Netherlands and even from China. Angeliki, Taeke and I talked with them about the Rijksmuseum API and technology in general. They came up with these amazing questions like 'How would you travel time?' and 'How could you extend the human sensory system?'. These questions were not meant to be answered seriously, of course. They were just meant for the purpose of brainstorming.

## Silly Hats

However, the questions did get answered seriously, sort of. There were people with silly hats, made of paper and cardboard and duct tape, which supposedly granted the wearer some sort of extrasensory perception like hearing smells and reading thoughts. It may seem weird to you, dear reader, and frankly it was. That was the purpose. Thinking out of the box. Getting the creative juices flowing. Boldly going where no one has gone before! The students from [Unacademic](http://unacademic.io) and the students from Sandberg collaborated, going head to head, brain to brain. Cerebral sparks nearly burned the building down. 

## Coffee Machine Debugging

Our students proved to be less tech-savvy than we imagined, though, as the coffee machine apparently was too much to handle for some of them. Programming? Hell yes! Coffee Machine? Get this diabolic device out of my presence! But then again, you cannot expect a programmer to solve a hardware problem, can you?
